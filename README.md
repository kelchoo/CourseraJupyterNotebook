### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

(3*4)+5
17

This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.
min=int(input("Enter time in minutes"))
h=min//60
m=min%60
print("Hours=",h)
print("Minutes=",m)

Enter time in minutes 200
Hours= 3
Minutes= 20
